# ## Laboratory 3: Partially observable Markov decision problems
# 
# In the end of the lab, you should export the notebook to a Python script (``File >> Download as >> Python (.py)``). Make sure that the resulting script includes all code written in the tasks marked as "**Activity n. N**", together with any replies to specific questions posed. Your file should be named `padi-labKK-groupXXX.py`, where `KK` corresponds to the lab number and the `XXX` corresponds to your group number. Similarly, your homework should consist of a single pdf file named `padi-hwKK-groupXXX.pdf`. You should create a zip file with the lab and homework files and submit it in Fenix **at most 30 minutes after your lab is over**.
# 
# Make sure to strictly respect the specifications in each activity, in terms of the intended inputs, outputs and naming conventions.
# 
# In particular, after completing the activities you should be able to replicate the examples provided (although this, in itself, is no guarantee that the activities are correctly completed).

# ### 1. The POMDP model
# 
# Consider once again POMDP problem from the homework. In this lab, you will interact with a larger version of that same problem, which describes the decision process of a gambler involved in a betting game. The game proceeds in rounds. At each round,
# 
# * The player is dealt a random card from the set {A&spades;, K&spades;, Q&spades;}. The card is left facing down.
# * The player must then either bet about which card he/she was dealt, or quit. There is a cost associated to quitting, but which is inferior to that of losing.
# * After betting/quitting, the card is revealed and the round ends.
# * Before betting, the player may also try to peek which card he/she was dealt (which is cheating). Of course that there is a risk associated with peeking (modeled as a cost). Peeking may or may not succeed.
# 
# The game can be described as a POMDP summarized in the diagram:
# 
# <img src="pomdp.png" width="600px">
# 
# In this lab you will use a POMDP based on the aforementioned domain and investigate how to simulate a partially observable Markov decision problem and track its state. You will also compare different MDP heuristics with the optimal POMDP solution.
# 
# **Throughout the lab, unless if stated otherwise, use $\gamma=0.99$.**
# 
# $$\diamond$$
# 
# In this first activity, you will implement a POMDP model in Python. You will start by loading the POMDP information from a `numpy` binary file, using the `numpy` function `load`. The file contains the list of states, actions, observations, transition probability matrices, observation probability matrices, and cost function.

# %% [markdown]

# 
# #### Activity 1.        
# 
# Write a function named `load_pomdp` that receives, as input, a string corresponding to the name of the file with the POMDP information, and a real number $\gamma$ between $0$ and $1$. The loaded file contains 6 arrays:
# 
# * An array `X` that contains all the states in the POMDP, represented as strings. In the gambling scenario above, for example, there is a total of 14 states, each describing a stage in the game. Specifically,
#     * `"I"` represents the initial state of the game, before the cards are dealt.
#     * `"2A"`, `"2B"`, and `"2C"` represent the 3 "dealt cards" states. The player only observes that the card has been dealt (corresponding to observation "2"), but does not know which of the three cards, "A", "B", or "C", it has.
#     * `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`correspond to the states where the player peeked into the hidden card. For example, `"A"` represents the state where the player was dealt card "A" and peeked into it. These states are reached from `"2A"`, `"2B"`, and `"2C"`, respectively, upon selecting the action "Peek".
#     * States `"3A"`, `"3B"`, and `"3C"` correspond to the states where the player bets. For example, `"3A"` represents the state where the player was dealt card "A" and must now make a bet, which can be "A", "B", or "C".
#     * States `"W"`and `"L"` correspond to winning and losing the game, respectively. State `"Q"` corresponds to the "Quit" state.
#     * State `"F"` represents the final state of the game, right before the game resets.
# * An array `A` that contains all the actions in the POMDP, also represented as strings. In the gambling domain above, for example, each action is represented as a single-letter string among `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"`, which represent different actions at different stages of the game. For example, in state `"I"`, since the agent does nothing but await the shuffle, all actions are equivalent and correspond to the action "Wait". However, in the dealt states, the actions `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"` correspond, respectively, to the actions "Peek", "Bet" and "Quit". In the betting states, actions `"a"`, `"b"` and `"c"` correspond to betting "A", "B", and "C", respectively.
# * An array `Z` that contains all the observations in the POMDP, also represented as strings. In the gambling domains above, for example, there is a total of 10 observations, corresponding to the observable features of the state: `"I"`, `"2"`, `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, `"3"`, `"W"`, `"Q"`, `"L"`, `"F"`.
# * An array `P` containing `len(A)` subarrays, each with dimension `len(X)` &times; `len(X)` and  corresponding to the transition probability matrix for one action.
# * An array `O` containing `len(A)` subarrays, each with dimension `len(X)` &times; `len(Z)` and  corresponding to the observation probability matrix for one action.
# * An array `c` with dimension `len(X)` &times; `len(A)` containing the cost function for the POMDP.
# 
# Your function should create the POMDP as a tuple `(X, A, Z, (Pa, a = 0, ..., len(A)), (Oa, a = 0, ..., len(A)), c, g)`, where `X` is a tuple containing the states in the POMDP represented as strings (see above), `A` is a tuple containing the actions in the POMDP represented as strings (see above), `Z` is a tuple containing the observations in the POMDP represented as strings (see above), `P` is a tuple with `len(A)` elements, where `P[a]` is an `np.array` corresponding to the transition probability matrix for action `a`, `O` is a tuple with `len(A)` elements, where `O[a]` is an `np.array` corresponding to the observation probability matrix for action `a`, `c` is an `np.array` corresponding to the cost function for the POMDP, and `g` is a float, corresponding to the discount and provided as the argument $\gamma$ of your function. Your function should return the POMDP tuple.

# You are now going to sample random trajectories of your POMDP and observe the impact it has on the corresponding belief.

# 
# #### Activity 2.
# 
# Write a function called `gen_trajectory` that generates a random POMDP trajectory using a uniformly random policy. Your function should receive, as input, a POMDP described as a tuple like that from **Activity 1** and two integers, `x0` and `n` and return a tuple with 3 elements, where:
# 
# 1. The first element is a `numpy` array corresponding to a sequence of `n + 1` state indices, $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n$, visited by the agent when following a uniform policy (i.e., a policy where actions are selected uniformly at random) from state with index `x0`. In other words, you should select $x_1$ from $x_0$ using a random action; then $x_2$ from $x_1$, etc.
# 2. The second element is a `numpy` array corresponding to the sequence of `n` action indices, $a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}$, used in the generation of the trajectory in 1.;
# 3. The third element is a `numpy` array corresponding to the sequence of `n` observation indices, $z_1,\ldots,z_n$, experienced by the agent during the trajectory in 1.
# 
# The `numpy` array in 1. should have a shape `(n + 1,)`; the `numpy` arrays from 2. and 3. should have a shape `(n,)`.
# 
# **Note:** Your function should work for **any** POMDP specified as above.

# You will now test the different MDP heuristics discussed in class. To that purpose, write down a function that, given a belief vector and the solution for the underlying MDP, computes the action prescribed by each of the three MDP heuristics. In particular, you should write down a function named `get_heuristic_action` that receives, as inputs:
# 
# * A belief state represented as a `numpy` array like those of **Activity 3**;
# * The optimal $Q$-function for an MDP (computed, for example, using the function `solve_mdp` from **Activity 4**);
# * A string that can be either `"mls"`, `"av"`, or `"q-mdp"`;
# 
# Your function should return an integer corresponding to the index of the action prescribed by the heuristic indicated by the corresponding string, i.e., the most likely state heuristic for `"mls"`, the action voting heuristic for `"av"`, and the $Q$-MDP heuristic for `"q-mdp"`.

# Comparing the FIB heuristic with the Q-MDP we can see that, just in some of the cases, they chose the same action. This happens because Q-MDP doesn't take into account the partial observability.
