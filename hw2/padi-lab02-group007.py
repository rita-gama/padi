# ## Laboratory 2: Markov decision problems
# 
# In the end of the lab, you should export the notebook to a Python script (``File >> Download as >> Python (.py)``). Make sure that the resulting script includes all code written in the tasks marked as "**Activity n. N**", together with any replies to specific questions posed. Your file should be named `padi-labKK-groupXXX.py`, where `KK` corresponds to the lab number and the `XXX` corresponds to your group number. Similarly, your homework should consist of a single pdf file named `padi-hwKK-groupXXX.pdf`. You should create a zip file with the lab and homework files and submit it in Fenix **at most 30 minutes after your lab is over**.
# 
# Make sure to strictly respect the specifications in each activity, in terms of the intended inputs, outputs and naming conventions.
# 
# In particular, after completing the activities you should be able to replicate the examples provided (although this, in itself, is no guarantee that the activities are correctly completed).

# ### 1. The MDP Model
# 
# Consider once again the taxi domain described in the Homework which you modeled using a Markov decision process. In this lab you will interact with larger version of the same problem, described by the diagram:
# 
# <img src="taxi.png" width="250px">
# 
# Recall that the MDP should describe the decision-making process of the taxi driver. In the domain above, 
# 
# * The taxi can be in any of the 25 cells in the diagram. The passenger can be at any of the 4 marked locations ($Y$, $B$, $G$, $R$) or in the taxi. Additionally, the passenger wishes to go to one of the 4 possible destinations. The total number of states, in this case, is $25\times 5\times 4$.
# * At each step, the agent (taxi driver) may move in any of the four directions -- south, north, east and west. It can also pickup the passenger or drop off the passenger. 
# * The goal of the taxi driver is to pickup the passenger and drop it at the passenger's desired destination.
# 
# In this lab you will use an MDP based on the aforementioned domain and investigate how to evaluate, solve and simulate a Markov decision problem.
# 
# **Throughout the lab, unless if stated otherwise, use $\gamma=0.99$.**
# 
# $$\diamond$$
# 
# In this first activity, you will implement an MDP model in Python. You will start by loading the MDP information from a `numpy` binary file, using the `numpy` function `load`. The file contains the list of states, actions, the transition probability matrices and cost function. After you load the file, you can index the resulting object as a dictionary to access the different elements.

# %% [markdown]
# ---
# 
# #### Activity 1.        
# 
# Write a function named `load_mdp` that receives, as input, a string corresponding to the name of the file with the MDP information, and a real number $\gamma$ between $0$ and $1$. The loaded file will contain 4 arrays:
# 
# * An array `X` that contains all the states in the MDP represented as strings. In the taxi domain above, for example, there is a total of 501 states, each describing the location of the taxi in the environment, the position of the passenger, and the destination of the passenger. Each state is, therefore, a string of the form `"(t, p, d)"`, where:
#     * `t` represents the position of the taxi in the grid;
#     * `p` is either `Taxi` (indicating that the passenger is in the taxi) or one of `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`, indicating the position of the passenger;
#     * `d` is one of `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`, indicating the destination of the passenger.
#     * There is one additional state, `"Final"`, to which the MDP transitions after dropping the passenger in its intended destination.
# * An array `A` that contains all the actions in the MDP, represented as strings. In the taxi domain above, for example, each action is represented as a string `"South"`, `"North"`, `"East"`, `"West"`, `"Pickup"`, and `"Drop"`.
# * An array `P` containing `len(A)` subarrays, each with dimension `len(X)` &times; `len(X)` and  corresponding to the transition probability matrix for one action.
# * An array `c` with dimension `len(X)` &times; `len(A)` containing the cost function for the MDP.
# 
# Your function should create the MDP as a tuple `(X, A, (Pa, a = 0, ..., len(A)), c, g)`, where `X` is a tuple containing the states in the MDP represented as strings (see above), `A` is a tuple containing the actions in the MDP represented as strings (see above), `P` is a tuple with `len(A)` elements, where `P[a]` is an `np.array` corresponding to the transition probability matrix for action `a`, `c` is an `np.array` corresponding to the cost function for the MDP, and `g` is a float, corresponding to the discount and provided as the argument $\gamma$ of your function. Your function should return the MDP tuple.

# Write a function `noisy_policy` that builds a noisy policy "around" a provided action. Your function should receive, as input, an MDP described as a tuple like that of **Activity 1**, an integer `a`, corresponding to the _index_ of an action in the MDP, and a real number `eps`. The function should return, as output, a policy for the provided MDP that selects action with index `a` with a probability `1 - eps` and, with probability `eps`, selects another action uniformly at random. The policy should be a `numpy` array with as many rows as states and as many columns as actions, where the element in position `[x, a]` should contain the probability of action `a` in state `x` according to the desired policy.
# 
# **Note:** The examples provided correspond for the MDP in the previous taxi environment. However, your code should be tested with MDPs of different sizes, so **make sure not to hard-code any of the MDP elements into your code**.

# ### 3. Control
# 
# In this section you are going to compare value and policy iteration, both in terms of time and number of iterations.

# %% [markdown]
# ---
# 
# #### Activity 4
# 
# In this activity you will show that the policy in Activity 3 is _not_ optimal. For that purpose, you will use value iteration to compute the optimal cost-to-go, $J^*$, and show that $J^*\neq J^\pi$. 
# 
# Write a function called `value_iteration` that receives as input an MDP represented as a tuple like that of **Activity 1** and returns an `numpy` array corresponding to the optimal cost-to-go function associated with that MDP. Before returning, your function should print:
# 
# * The time it took to run, in the format `Execution time: xxx seconds`, where `xxx` represents the number of seconds rounded up to $3$ decimal places.
# * The number of iterations, in the format `N. iterations: xxx`, where `xxx` represents the number of iterations.
# 
# **Note 1:** Stop the algorithm when the error between iterations is smaller than $10^{-8}$. To compute the error between iterations, you should use the function `norm` from `numpy.linalg`. 
# 
# **Note 2:** You may find useful the function ``time()`` from the module ``time``. You may also find useful the code provided in the theoretical lecture.
# 
# **Note 3:** The array returned by your function should have as many rows as the number of states in the received MDP, and exactly one column. As before, your function should work with **any** MDP that is specified as a tuple with the same structure as the one from **Activity 1**.

# You will now compute the optimal policy using policy iteration.

# * The number of iterations, in the format `N. iterations: xxx`, where `xxx` represents the number of iterations.
# 
# **Note:** If you find that numerical errors affect your computations (especially when comparing two values/arrays) you may use the `numpy` function `isclose` with adequately set absolute and relative tolerance parameters (e.g., $10^{-8}$). You may also find useful the code provided in the theoretical lecture.

# ### 4. Simulation
# 
# Finally, in this section you will check whether the theoretical computations of the cost-to-go actually correspond to the cost incurred by an agent following a policy.

# %% [markdown]
# ---
# 
# #### Activity 6
# 
# Write a function `simulate` that receives, as inputs
# 
# * An MDP represented as a tuple like that of **Activity 1**;
# * A policy, represented as an `numpy` array like that of **Activity 2**;
# * An integer, `x0`, corresponding to a state index
# * A second integer, `length`
# 
# Your function should return, as an output, a float corresponding to the estimated cost-to-go associated with the provided policy at the provided state. To estimate such cost-to-go, your function should:
# 
# * Generate **`NRUNS`** trajectories of `length` steps each, starting in the provided state and following the provided policy. 
# * For each trajectory, compute the accumulated (discounted) cost. 
# * Compute the average cost over the 100 trajectories.
# 
# **Note 1:** You may find useful to import the numpy module `numpy.random`.
# 
# **Note 2:** Each simulation may take a bit of time, don't despair ☺️.
